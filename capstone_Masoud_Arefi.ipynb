    "# Heart Stroke Prediction and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Heart strokes significantly impact global health, with a surprising fact: 80% of heart strokes are preventable. This notebook explores key indicators leading to heart strokes, using data from diverse age groups, genders, habits, and health issues. Our visualizations aim to be intuitive, employing simple yet effective methods for conveying essential information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to visualize the relationships between various lifestyle habits and heart stroke occurrences. We aim to predict stroke probability using optimally tuned models, providing insights for preventive health measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions and Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we will investigate several questions and assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Impact of Age**: Does age significantly influence stroke occurrence, and what is its distribution across populations?\n",
    "2. **BMI and Glucose Levels**: How do higher body mass index and glucose levels correlate with stroke risk?\n",
    "3. **Smoking and Stroke Risk**: Is there a strong link between smoking and increased stroke risk?\n",
    "4. **Heart Disease and Stroke**: How closely are existing heart diseases and stroke occurrences related?\n",
    "5. **Workload and Blood Pressure**: Can high workload and resultant blood pressure increases lead to strokes?\n",
    "6. **Gender-Specific Risks**: Are males more prone to strokes due to work-related stress, or do risks vary across genders?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive examination of the dataset to understand feature distribution and relationships.\n",
    "- **Visualizations**: Using plots and charts to uncover patterns and insights.\n",
    "- **Statistical Testing**: Validating assumptions and hypotheses through statistical methods.\n",
    "- **Model Building**: Developing predictive models for stroke risk estimation.\n",
    "- **Feature Importance**: Identifying key factors that significantly influence stroke risk.\n",
    "- **Feature Selection**: Enhancing model accuracy by selecting relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to provide a deeper understanding of the factors leading to heart strokes and their interplay, essential for developing preventive strategies and early interventions.\n"
