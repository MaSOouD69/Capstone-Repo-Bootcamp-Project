Stroke Prediction and Analysis
Introduction
Strokes have a significant impact on global health, with an astonishing fact that 80% of strokes are preventable. This analysis delves into key indicators leading to strokes, encompassing data from various age groups, genders, habits, and health conditions. Our goal is to present intuitive visualizations that effectively communicate crucial information.


Problem Statement
The focus is to visualize and understand the relationship between lifestyle habits and the occurrence of heart strokes. We aim to predict the probability of strokes using finely tuned models, thereby contributing to preventive health strategies.


Questions and Assumptions
Our investigation revolves around several key questions and assumptions:


Impact of Age: Exploring the influence of age on stroke occurrence and its distribution across different populations.
BMI and Glucose Levels: Examining the correlation between higher BMI and glucose levels with stroke risk.
Smoking and Stroke Risk: Investigating the potential link between smoking habits and increased stroke risk.
Heart Disease and Stroke: Assessing the relationship between existing heart conditions and stroke occurrences.
Workload and Blood Pressure: Analyzing if high workload and subsequent blood pressure increases contribute to stroke risk.
Gender-Specific Risks: Evaluating whether males are more prone to strokes due to work-related stress or if the risks vary across genders.

Methodology
Data Analysis: Thorough examination of the dataset to understand feature distributions and interrelationships.
Visualizations: Employing various plots and charts to reveal patterns and insights.
Statistical Testing: Utilizing statistical methods to validate assumptions and hypotheses.
Model Building: Creating predictive models to estimate stroke risk.
Feature Importance: Identifying and focusing on key factors that significantly influence stroke risk.
Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features to enhance model accuracy and performance.

Conclusion
This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors leading to strokes and their interactions. The insights gained are crucial for formulating effective preventive measures and early intervention strategies.
