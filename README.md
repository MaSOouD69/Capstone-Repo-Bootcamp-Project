Data Science Bootcamp: November 2023 - February 2024

Welcome to my Capstone Project for the Brainstation Data Science Bootcamp. This project represents the culmination of intensive learning and hands-on experience in data science from November 2023 to February 2024.

Project Overview

Project Description
This capstone project is centered around developing a predictive analysis tool in medical data science, focusing on diseases like heart failure, stroke, diabetes, and cancer. The aim is to create a model that predicts the likelihood of these health conditions based on medical and demographic data.

Objective
The primary goal is to leverage data science and machine learning to provide early warnings for critical health conditions, aiding in early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.

Key Challenges
Data Quality and Reliability: Ensuring the datasets used are accurate and reliable.
Model Accuracy and Validation: Building models that are not only accurate but also clinically valid.
Handling Imbalanced Data: Dealing with the common issue of imbalanced datasets in medical data.
Ethical Considerations: Addressing data privacy and ethical concerns in predictive healthcare analytics.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python, including libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn.
Data Visualization: Using Matplotlib and Seaborn for insights visualization.
Machine Learning Frameworks: Exploring TensorFlow or PyTorch for advanced modeling.

Expected Outcomes
Project: A robust predictive model for disease risk assessment.
Personal Development: Improved expertise in data science and machine learning, with a focus on healthcare applications.

Why This Project?
I am deeply interested in the convergence of data science and healthcare. This project offers the opportunity to impact patient care through predictive analytics, aligning with my passion for applying data science to solve real-world problems and enhancing my skills in this critical area.

# Stroke Prediction and Analysis

## Introduction

Strokes significantly impact global health, with a surprising fact: 80% of strokes are preventable. This notebook explores key indicators leading to strokes, using data from diverse age groups, genders, habits, and health issues. Our visualizations aim to be intuitive, employing simple yet effective methods for conveying essential information.

## Problem Statement

Our goal is to visualize the relationships between various lifestyle habits and heart stroke occurrences. We aim to predict stroke probability using optimally tuned models, providing insights for preventive health measures.

## Questions and Assumptions

In this analysis, we will investigate several questions and assumptions:

1. **Impact of Age**: Does age significantly influence stroke occurrence, and what is its distribution across populations?
2. **BMI and Glucose Levels**: How do higher body mass index and glucose levels correlate with stroke risk?
3. **Smoking and Stroke Risk**: Is there a strong link between smoking and increased stroke risk?
4. **Heart Disease and Stroke**: How closely are existing heart diseases and stroke occurrences related?
5. **Workload and Blood Pressure**: Can high workload and resultant blood pressure increases lead to strokes?
6. **Gender-Specific Risks**: Are males more prone to strokes due to work-related stress, or do risks vary across genders?

## Methodology

- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive examination of the dataset to understand feature distribution and relationships.
- **Visualizations**: Using plots and charts to uncover patterns and insights.
- **Statistical Testing**: Validating assumptions and hypotheses through statistical methods.
- **Model Building**: Developing predictive models for stroke risk estimation.
- **Feature Importance**: Identifying key factors that significantly influence stroke risk.
- **Feature Selection**: Enhancing model accuracy by selecting relevant features.

## Conclusion

This notebook aims to provide a deeper understanding of the factors leading to strokes and their interplay, essential for developing preventive strategies and early interventions.
